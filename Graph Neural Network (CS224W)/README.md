# Colab 1: Learning Node Embeddings (Demo)
Overview: the node embeddings are trained to predict the edges.
Existing edges serve as the postive samples, while the random sampled unknown edges serve as the negative samples. The score of an edge is calculated based on the inner product of embeddings associated with the corresponding nodes. Cross-entropy loss is used.

# Colab 2: GCN (for node properties prediction)
# Colab 3: GraphSAGE (for node classification)
# Colab 4: GAT 
# Colab 5: Heterogeneous GNN (for )
